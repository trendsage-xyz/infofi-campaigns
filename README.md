# infofi-campaigns

TrendSage is building the protocol infrastructure for a permissionless, campaign-first, creator-aligned attention economy.

Our mission is to:

- Empower Projects to launch customizable, story-centric campaigns that attract loyal contributors — not just paid noise.
- Rank and Reward Creators based on true narrative impact and alignment — not follower count or farmed engagement.
- Convert Influence to Ownership by bridging campaign performance with token allocations, launchpad access, and DAO participation.
- Enable Transparent Collaboration using AI scoring, on-chain escrow, and reputation-linked oracles — replacing shill deals with trustless systems.

We’re not a dashboard or another “X-to-earn” product.
We are a mindshare engine — powering the campaigns, launches, and attention rails for crypto’s next cycle.
